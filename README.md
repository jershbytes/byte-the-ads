This is a curated list of 11 block lists that my friend uses that I used to turn into one mega list. 

- Lists can be found [here](./adlists.txt)

To use this in pihole just add 

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jershbytes/pihole-blocklist/refs/heads/main/blocklist.txt
```

to the `Adlists` Section.

- Then go to `http://pihole.local/admin/gravity.php`
    
    - Hit the update button and you should be using the list.
